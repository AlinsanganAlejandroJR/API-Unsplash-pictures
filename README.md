# Udemy Tutorial Picture API

In this project, I learned how to use axios package to fetch data from an API endpoint in which we use Unsplash-API.
This app also show how to utilize the async and await function to sync the data to the react app.

It also demonstrate how data flow works from api to other components. Using deconstructuring objects we can pass props or properties from components to components.

It is very important to learn how we can connect and fetch data from API and to render it on our react app.
